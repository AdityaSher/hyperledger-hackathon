# Questions and Answers

## What is the theme of the event? It is focused on Financial Services, or broader  -   
The spirit of the event is for dutch hackers to get acquinted with Hyperledger blockchain, and for the Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee to get feedback on the current status of Hyperledger platform and architecture. Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee will be available for mentoring, as well as IBM bluemix and blockchain experts and the ABN AMRO Blockchain IT core team. 
Starting point is building use cases on Hyperledger platform. So you can pick up any use case, not limited to Financial Services. However, as we cooperate with Holland Fintech, and as we will have some ABN AMRO internal teams as well, I personally do expect majority of use cases to be Finance oriented.  
Also,  IBM will provide a "dummy" bank which will be able to be accesed via APIs.
