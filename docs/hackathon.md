# Hackathon
General information


## Hardware & Software
Bring your own laptop. Three main operating systems are supported: Windows, macOS and Linux. Preferably the latest version of these systems.

During the hackathon, if all goes wrong and youâ€™re under the impression that the setup is taking too much time, we are also providing a limited amount of laptops with Ubuntu and Fabric preconfigured. There will also be a Virtualbox Ubuntu image available for you to use.
