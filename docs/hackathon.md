# Hackathon
General information

## Teams
As a rule of thumb for hackathons: the more coders the better. You need to get an application up and running in a very short amount of time. Diagrams and graphic design are important, but what matters is the end result: the application.

## Hardware & Software
Bring your own laptop. Three main operating systems are supported: Windows, macOS and Linux. Preferably the latest version of these systems.

During the hackathon, if all goes wrong and youâ€™re under the impression that the setup is taking too much time, we are also providing a limited amount of laptops with Ubuntu and Fabric preconfigured. There will also be a Virtualbox Ubuntu image available for you to use.

## Criteria
### Use case or idea

Adressing an actual problem to begin with | 3
Blockchain facets to adress the problem | 2
Immutability, Provenance, Consensus, Finality, Trust and Visibility | 2
Extend or extendability of the Business Network | 3
Clear personas that reflect the business network | 1

### Eco-system impact & Innovation
- Clear benefits for members in the network
- Clear vision on smart contracting between members
- Societal impact
- Value chain disruption (inc. de-intermediation)
- New business opportunity / model
- Process optimisation across the value chain 
- Involvement of a controller/regulator

### Quality of the pitch
- Identification of a Hyperledger improvement
- Appealing design
- Obviousness of solving the problem statement
- Privacy taken into account
- Visible audit trail to demonstrate transparency
- Use of other APIs and/or services (inc. Dummy bank)

### Correct Hyperledger Usage
- Usage of membership service
- Chaincode should:
  - be deterministic
  - not be computationally expensive
  - check roles correctly
- Extra points for:
  - using off chain storage
  - breaking chaincode up into components
